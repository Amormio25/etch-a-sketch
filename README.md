# etch-a-sketch
Learning more DOM Manipulation and Flexbox properties!

This project is a browser-based version of a sketchpad similar to the
original Etch-A-Sketch created in 1960!

By taking on this project, I will strengthen my skills in DOM Manipulation, 
styling with CSS, and continue to develop my skills as a programmer!
